#   `parsers`
---

The `parsers` services are used to parse several types of documents in an Obsidian vault.
There are *functional* parsers:

- `yaml` - YAML parser

And *non-functional, domain-specific* parsers:

- parsers for note-taking
    -   `ftparser`: parses format-specific 'fleeting-thought' notes.
