# Bardo Thödol (Lama Kazi Dawa Samdup)
## Resumo
> The _Bardo Thödol_, often translated as _The Tibetan Book of the Dead_, is a guide to the states of consciousness experienced at death and in the intermediate realm between death and rebirth. Rooted in Tibetan Buddhist philosophy, it is intended to be read aloud to the dying or deceased to aid recognition of the mind’s true nature and liberation from the cycle of rebirth. The text describes the three main bardos: the _Chikhai Bardo_ (the moment of death, when the Clear Light of reality appears), the _Chönyid Bardo_ (visions of peaceful and wrathful deities reflecting the mind’s projections), and the _Sidpa Bardo_ (the passage toward rebirth shaped by karmic tendencies). Central to its teaching is the possibility of awakening through direct recognition of the Clear Light or, failing that, navigating the visionary experiences with awareness to avoid fearful rebirths. The _Bardo Thödol_ thus serves as both a practical manual for the dying and a profound philosophical treatise on impermanence, consciousness, and liberation.

## Sobre o livro
The _Bardo Thödol_ is one of the central texts of Tibetan Buddhism, attributed to Padmasambhava and preserved by his disciple Yeshe Tsogyal in the 8th century. Its title means “Liberation Through Hearing in the Intermediate State,” and that function defines the text: it is not meant to be studied silently but read aloud to someone who is dying or already dead. The spoken words are believed to reach the consciousness that lingers between lives, reminding it of the truth of mind and guiding it toward liberation.

The book is structured around the “bardos” — transitional states of being. It identifies six bardos in total, but the text focuses on three that unfold in the death process:

- **Chikhai Bardo (Moment of Death):** The consciousness encounters the “Clear Light,” a pure awareness beyond form. Recognizing it leads directly to enlightenment; failing to recognize it results in further passage through the bardos.
    
- **Chönyid Bardo (Experiencing Reality):** The mind generates visions of deities, first peaceful then wrathful. These are not external beings but symbolic displays of one’s own mind. Recognition leads to liberation; fear and confusion deepen karmic entanglement.
    
- **Sidpa Bardo (Rebirth):** Consciousness, propelled by desire and karmic force, seeks a new existence. If clarity is not attained, the mind gravitates toward a womb or other rebirth conditions, sealing the cycle of samsara.
    

The text is both pragmatic and visionary. On one hand, it gives detailed instructions on how to guide the dying and newly dead. On the other, it is a philosophical map of consciousness, showing how perception, fear, and desire shape the realities we inhabit. At its heart lies a consistent message: liberation is always possible, but it depends on recognition — seeing appearances as the play of mind and not mistaking them for external realities.

The _Bardo Thödol_ also functions symbolically for the living. The bardos of death mirror transitional states within life: moments of loss, transformation, meditation, and dreaming. In this way, the book is not just a manual for the dead but a mirror for the living, reminding readers that every moment offers a threshold to awakening.
