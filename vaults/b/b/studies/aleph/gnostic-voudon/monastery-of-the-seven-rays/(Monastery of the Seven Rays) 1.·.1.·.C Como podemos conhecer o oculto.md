### Attainment as Self-Realization

Ultimate occult knowledge arises when purified layers of being converge, revealing that the seeker **is** the "infinite process of light" [citation:User Context]. This state—termed "True Freedom"—manifests as uninterrupted communion with divine currents, echoing the Hermetic axiom: "That which is within is beyond" [citation:User Context]314.

> _"Purification is not denial but transfiguration: the body becomes a temple, the soul a vessel, the spirit a lens, and the divinity—the boundless sky."_  
> — Gnostic Voudon Maxim

For practitioners, this path demands disciplined integration of daily rituals with transcendent aims, guided by a master to avoid pitfalls like the "Meon" (void of dissolution) [citation:User Context]
