# 1.·.3.·.A Quais poderes tem o ocultista, em relação ao não-ocultista
---
### I. Transmutative Power

- **Alchemical Mastery**: The occultist commands the ancient science of transmutation—altering material substances and physical laws by manipulating their essences. This extends beyond folklore (e.g., turning base matter into gold) to fundamental control over gravity, magnetism, and atomic properties.
    
- **Basis in Initiation**: Such power is reserved for advanced initiates trained in the Monastery’s proprietary alchemical methods.
    

### II. Expanded Consciousness

- **Planetary and Stellar Awareness**: Through rigorous astrological study and meditative discipline, the occultist develops consciousness attuned to celestial bodies:
    
    1. **Intellectual Mastery**: Expertise in astrological sciences.
        
    2. **Meditative Identification**: Mind merges with the target star or planet.
        
    3. **Intuitive Unity**: Essence of the celestial body becomes inseparable from the occultist’s being.
        
- **Evolutionary Superiority**: This universalized consciousness places the occultist centuries ahead of humanity’s current evolutionary state.
    

### III. Interdimensional Interaction

- **Evocation and Invocation**: The occultist safely navigates contact with non-human entities through:
    
    - **Magical Linguistics**: Mastery of sacred names and sounds to identify and commune with spiritual beings.
        
    - **Initiated Discernment**: Avoids dangers inherent to ill-prepared exploration of these realms.
        

### IV. Heightened Perceptual Faculties

- **Beyond Psychic Phenomena**: While non-occultists may exhibit sporadic psychic abilities (e.g., clairvoyance), the occultist possesses _systematically refined perception_:
    
    - **Sensory Acuity**: Detects subtle colors, sounds, and energies imperceptible to ordinary senses (akin to artists or musicians, but without aesthetic training).
        
    - **Omni-Awareness**: Deepening sensitivity to the environment culminates in identification with the universe itself.
        

### V. The Core Principle

> **"THE POWERS OF THE OCCULTIST ARE THE NORMAL FUNCTIONS OF THAT PART OF THE UNIVERSE INTO WHICH HE IS EVOLVING."**

- **Evolutionary Destiny**: These abilities signify the occultist’s transition into a future human paradigm—where such powers are innate.
    
- **Unity with the Cosmos**: The occultist ceases to perceive the universe as external. They _become_ the cosmic processes they once sought to understand.
    

### Conclusion

The occultist’s powers are neither aberrations nor parlor tricks. They are **evolutionary milestones** marking the emergence of a new human species—one harmonized with the spiritual architecture of existence. Mastery demands utter surrender to the light, purification of body and soul, and relentless pursuit of cosmic unity. As the initiate evolves, they cease to wield powers; they _embody_ the universe’s latent potential.
