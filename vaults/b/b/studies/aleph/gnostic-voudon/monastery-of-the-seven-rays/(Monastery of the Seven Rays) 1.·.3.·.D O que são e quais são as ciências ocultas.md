# 1.·.3.·.D O que são e quais são as ciências ocultas
---

Based on the teachings of Master Mercurius Aquarius, the occult sciences are **not discrete fields of study** but a **unified process of conscious thought** applied to esoteric experience. The core principles are as follows:

### I. THE SINGULAR SCIENCE: LOGIC

> **"THERE IS ONLY ONE OCCULT SCIENCE — THOUGHT OR LOGIC."**  
> Occult science is fundamentally the science of _conscious thought_, structured through four sequential phases:

1. **Construction**
    
    - Gathering raw experiences into homogeneous "areas of experience" (e.g., astrology, magic, mysticism).
        
    - Separating similar from dissimilar phenomena to form cohesive investigative fields.
        
2. **Interpretation**
    
    - Infusing constructed areas with deeper meaning.
        
    - Dividing each area into:
        
        - **Field**: The factual, historical manifestation (e.g., existing astrological texts and practices).
            
        - **Domain**: The ideal, evolutionary potential (e.g., astrology's metaphysical principles).
            
3. **Description**
    
    - Defining _what is_ within the Field, affirming truth and discarding falsehood.
        
    - "Bringing into existence" through precise language (e.g., describing planetary influences).
        
4. **Explanation**
    
    - Revealing _why_ phenomena exist through metaphysical/spiritual causality.
        
    - The "language of the gods," linking present reality to future perfection (e.g., explaining astrological laws via cosmic consciousness).
        

### II. AREAS OF EXPERIENCE (NOT "SCIENCES")

These are the raw materials for occult science, later refined through the four-phase process:

1. **Astrology**: Relationship between humanity and celestial bodies.
    
2. **Extra-Sensory Perception & Parapsychology**: Relationship between humanity and subtle energies.
    
3. **Magic**: Relationship between humanity and symbolic/created realities.
    
4. **Mysticism**: Relationship between humanity and divine intuition.
    

### III. KEY DISTINCTIONS

- **Field vs. Domain**:
    
    - _Field_: Empirical, historical manifestations (laboratory-focused).
        
    - _Domain_: Speculative, ideal evolution (museum-focused).
        
- **Description vs. Explanation**:
    
    - Description answers _"What is?"_ (Field-work).
        
    - Explanation answers _"Why is it?"_ (Domain-work).
        

### IV. THE OCCULT SCIENTIST'S ROLE

- **As Mediator**: Masters bridge the Field (human experience) and Domain (divine ideals).
    
- **As Refiner**: Rejecting historical errors to "narrow the Field" (e.g., discarding false astrological claims).
    
- **As Cosmic Architect**: Mirroring Plato's Demiurge in _Timaeus_, building worlds by layering meaning onto experience.
    

### V. REJECTION OF CONVENTIONAL CATEGORIES

The Master dismisses:

- Lists of "occult sciences" as superficial.
    
- Materialist denial of esoteric subject matter.
    
- Vague, unrefined "areas of experience" as incomplete without logical structuring.
    

### Conclusion

True occult science is **Logic in action** — a dynamic process transforming raw experience into illuminated understanding. It demands rigor: constructing precise frameworks, interpreting through dual lenses (Field/Domain), describing with exactitude, and explaining via spiritual causality. This approach transcends fragmented disciplines, revealing the underlying unity of all knowledge. As Master Aquarius states: _"Truth is itself perfectly one."_

> _"Occult science is the alchemy of thought: constructing, interpreting, describing, and explaining reality until the base metal of experience becomes the gold of wisdom."_
