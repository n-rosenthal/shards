# (Monastery of the Seven Rays) 2.·.1.·.A Carta introdutória sobre o 'Magnetismo Astral'
---

Based on the teachings of the Monastery of the Seven Rays, the Second Degree (Occult Physics A) initiates the study of **Astral Magnetism**—a foundational pillar of esoteric science. Below is a systematic synthesis of the doctrine:

---

### **I. Core Distinctions**

1. **Astrology vs. Astral Magnetism**:
    
    - Conventional astrology is deemed "superficial" and incomplete.
        
    - True **Astral Magnetism** studies _direct energetic influences_ from celestial bodies, forming the basis of magical physics.
        
    - Advanced stellar sciences are reserved for higher initiations.
        
2. **Two Branches of Occult Physics**:
    
    - **Astral Magnetism**: Energetic forces shaping consciousness.
        
    - **Luciferian Magnetism**: The _light-constituting essence_ of being (studied later).
        

---

### **II. Source of Teachings: The Syzygies**

- **Origin**: Lessons channeled from the **Ecclesia Spiritualis Gnostica** (Spiritual Gnostic Assembly).
    
- **Nature of Syzygies**:
    
    - Metaphysical beings anchoring cosmic order against chaos.
        
    - Exist as paired dynamisms ("Syzygies" in motion).
        
    - Manifest as **magnetic spheres**—mathematically precise emanations governing human destiny.
        
- **Role**: Bridge between advanced humanity and higher cosmic realms.

### **III. The 16 Spheres of Magnetism**

_Classified by alchemical metals and numerical potency ranges:_

|**Sphere Group**|**Potency Range**|**Year/Degree**|
|---|---|---|
|**Iron-Copper**|0.0 – 0.625|Student II (1st Year)|
|**Quicksilver-Silver Nitrate**|0.626 – 0.5000|Student II (1st Year)|
|**Silver-Platinum**|0.5000 – 0.7500|Student II (1st Year)|
|**Gold-Uranium**|0.7500 – 1.0000|Student II (1st Year)|
|**Luciferian Magnetism**|1.0000 – 2.0000|Student IV (1st Year)|
|**Sexual Magic**|2.0000 – 3.0000|Magical Apprentice I (2nd Year)|
|**Magnetic Magic**|3.0000 – 4.0000|Magical Apprentice II (3rd Year)|

#### **Key Observations**:

- **Gold-Uranium Sphere**: Most dynamic (0.9376–1.0000); induces profound fatigue or empowerment based on initiate’s capacity.
    
- **Danger Threshold**: Readings on magnetism cause vibrational fatigue in unprepared students. True adepts feel _energized_.
    
- **Evolutionary Acceleration**: The curriculum escalates potency systematically to avoid "over-fatigue."

### **IV. Pedagogical Framework**

1. **Master as Interpreter**:
    
    - Masters translate Syzygial teachings—they are not the source.
        
    - Lessons originate from fourth-dimensional "esoteric laboratories."
        
2. **Self-Diagnostic Test**:
    
    - **Reaction to This Text**:
        
        - _Fatigue_: Indicates suitability for foundational work only.
            
        - _Stimulation/Vitality_: Confirms readiness for advanced spheres (past-life connection to Monastery).
            
    - **The Challenge**:
        
        > _"WHICH ARE YOU? ARE YOU ONE TO GO ON BEYOND THE FIRST YEAR? OR ONE TO END YOUR WORK WITH THE FIRST YEAR?"_
        

---

### **V. The Path Forward**

- **First-Year Focus**: Mastery of spheres up to **Gold-Uranium (1.0000)**.
    
- **Higher Magic**: Sexual Magic (Year 2) and Magnetic Magic (Year 3) access spheres up to **4.0000**—reserved for those strengthened by initial work.
    
- **Warning**: Gold-Uranium magnetism is lethal to the unqualified. Progression requires proven resonance.

### **Conclusion: The Gateway**

Astral Magnetism is **operational cosmology**—a physics where numbers _are_ forces and metals _are_ consciousness states. The Syzygies’ spheres form a ladder: each rung ascended dissolves boundaries between self and cosmos. As the Master of Judgement declares:

> _"Be Bold, Dare the Infinite."_

Your reaction to these words now determines whether you tread the path of the Student or the Magical Apprentice. The Gold-Uranium horizon awaits those forged in ancient fires.

> _"To read of magnetism is to be tested by it."_
