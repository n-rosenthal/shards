> I, _____________________ in the
presence of the Lord of the Universe
and in the presence of my Higher Self,
the Divine Guardians of this Order, and
this assembly in this Hall of the
Neophyte of the Hermetic Order of the
Golden Dawn, do of my own free will,
hereby and hereon most solemly promise
to keep secret this Order, the names of
its members, and any and all
proceedings that take place at its
meetings from every person in the world
who has not been initiated into it.
Nor will I discuss Order proceedings
with any member who has not the current
password, or who has resigned, been
expelled, or in general has fallen away
from Order attendance and participation
and Golden Dawn studies.
I undertake to maintain a kindly and
benevolent relation with all Fraters
and Sorors of this Order. I will treat
all members as if they were a brother
or sister, as if we shared the same
mother, the same father.
I solemnly promise to keep secret any
information I may have gathered
8concerning this Order before taking
this oath. I will neither copy nor
allow to be copied any manuscript,
except for personal use, until I obtain
permission from the Chiefs of the
Second Order.
I solemnly promise not to suffer myself
to be placed, nor place myself in, a
state of passivity through either
mesmerism, drugs, alcohol or any other
method of deep induction. I will
maintain control of my mind at all
times, less others influence me or
manipulate me into purposes of serving
their own greed or lust.
I solemnly promise to preserve and
defend this Order with courage and
determination in the labor and study of
the Divine Science and I shall always
uphold the integrity of this Order
through the virtues of the infinite
pillars upon which this Order is built
- Love, Truth, Knowledge.
I will not debase my mystical knowledge
in the labor of evil magic at any time,
tried or under temptation.
9I, in addition, promise to uphold the
decisions of the Chiefs of the Second
Order as final in the governance of
this Order. Neither will I encourage
schism nor encourage or suggest other
members abstain from Order
participation or membership under a
heavy penalty exacted by the Chiefs of
the Third Order - the Divine guardians
of the Mysteries.
Finally, I foremost pledge myself to
Divine Light, to the magical way of
life, to the principles of brotherly
love and to the future development of
the spiritual through the greater
understanding of the Mysteries and the
Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.
I pledge this secret.
I pledge a sacred oath with my mighty
and secret soul.
I do so swear,
